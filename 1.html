  <p><u>In 2020, HelloTalk is the king of the language exchange apps.</u> Or at least, a member of the royal family. It has over 18 million users — that’s over twice the population of New York City! If you don’t want to read this whole list, just download HelloTalk and go from there.</p>

  <p>New users fill in a profile and the app suggests similar profiles of people you might enjoy connecting with. The chat feature is very developed: you can send photos, emojis and doodles to your new language partners. Once you’ve gained each other’s trust, it’s even possible to send voice messages and make phone calls for free! The free version of HelloTalk will be sufficient for most learners, but you can only set one target language. Consider a subscription if you’re trying to master a few languages at once.</p>

  <p>One of the age-old problems of language exchanges is that learners find it hard to know when to switch languages. HelloTalk has a handy feature to prevent the awkwardness of trying to be strict with a relative stranger. If you turn on “Language Exchange mode,” you’ll get a notification when it’s time to switch languages. With so many users passing through, it’s slightly more suited to those who want to casually chat than to have a more developed language exchange. However, HelloTalk deserves its great reputation.</p>
