    <p>Like HelloTalk, <strong>Tandem is a very up-to-date language exchange app with millions of users.</strong> As the name suggests, it is a Tandem language app, which has been called the Tinder of language exchange apps. But don’t let that put you off: the majority of people are here to learn. Once you’ve filled in a quick profile, your inbox will quickly receive lots of messages.</p>

    <p>With so many users, it can be hard to focus on one conversation at a time or to move beyond superficial topics, but the app is very slick to look at and easy to navigate. You can leave reviews of other users, which makes the relationships between students feel more professional and less akin to a dating app. You can send voice notes or video chat, but there isn’t much of a culture of doing either, since most interactions are spur-of-the-moment. There’s a handy “correct this message” feature to help your partner out without derailing the conversation.</p>

    <p>If you want to enjoy language exchanges through a slick, up-to-date messaging app, Tandem is a great option.</p>
